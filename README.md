A2 interface prototype
======================

This is an exploration in a new editing interface for [Apostrophe 2](https://github.com/punkave/apostrophe). This isn't the intended implementation, nor is it feature-complete... Just a lil prototype!

Usage
-----

once the server is running, hit `localhost:3000/pages/<name>` to create a page. You can continue to access that page at the specified URL.

The Page system isn't 100% wired up, so you will see text changes saved to the database but not images, text merging, floated-images-and-text areas, or content deletions.

Opinions & Ideas
----------------

...should be expressed using Issues in this repo!
